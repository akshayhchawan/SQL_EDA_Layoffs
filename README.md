‚ú® **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering Insights and Unlocking Future Possibilities** ‚ú®

EDA is like opening the door to endless possibilities in data analysis. It‚Äôs a crucial first step that lays the foundation for meaningful insights and future visualizations. By approaching the data with an open mind, EDA helps reveal patterns, trends, and potential directions for deeper analysis.

In my recent project, I conducted a thorough EDA on a Layoff Dataset using MySQL, and here's how it unfolded: 

üîç SITUATION: The task at hand was to explore layoff data, understand the trends, and uncover potential insights that could guide further analysis.

üéØ TASK: The dataset contained fields such as company, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, country, and more. My objective was to break down the data, find meaningful insights, and prepare for further analysis and visualizations.

üí° ACTION: 
1. Highest Layoffs & 100% Layoffs: I started by looking at the highest layoffs and companies with 100% layoffs using the MAX function. We found 116 companies with 100% layoffs over three years, which opens up future questions on their current condition and why they experienced complete layoffs. 
2. Total Layoffs by Top Companies: Next, we identified top companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta leading in total layoffs.
3. Industry & Country Insights: Consumer and retail industries stood out as having the highest layoffs. Geographically, the US had 7x more layoffs than India, which makes sense given the global giants headquartered there.
4. Yearly Trends: Surprisingly, layoffs were much lower during the COVID-19 years (2020-2021) compared to post-pandemic periods, which invites further exploration.
5. Funding vs Layoffs: Companies with higher funding were laying off more employees, another key insight to dive deeper into.
6. Rolling Total by Month: Finally, I calculated the rolling total of layoffs by month, a key figure for future visualizations and understanding long-term trends.



üöÄ RESULT: This open-minded exploration provided invaluable direction for further analysis, such as understanding the long-term impacts of 100% layoffs or visualizing rolling totals for more comprehensive insights.

EDA opens doors, and with each door, new insights are ready to be unlocked. The project has set the stage for deeper investigations into company behavior, funding impacts, and layoff trends.
